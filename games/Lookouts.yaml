  Lookouts is a romance visual novel about two gay trans masc outlaws in the old west, finding refuge in each other, and a little hope for a better life. With roughly 45,000 words of story and a 5-6 hour reading time, it's a much expanded version of the original jam game we made for the Gay Western Jam.
