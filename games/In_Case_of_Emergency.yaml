  ##FEATURES
  Define your own character: Choose dialogue options that define your player character. Accrue points in the archetypes "Alpha Chad," "Male Feminist," or "King of the Nerds" to unlock unique dialogue and choices.

  Multiple love interests: The game contains one central "route" that follows the main plot. Romantic (or otherwise character-unique) plotlines take place alongside it. Non-romantic/sexual relationships are also available.

  Mature content: Death, taxes, dick jokes, and other highbrow stuff. Also, sex. (Explicit sexual content can be toggled on or off, but this game is still intended for audiences 18 and up.)
